Eleonora is primarily supervised by Dr Giovanni Sena of the plant morphogenesis group at Imperial: http://www.imperial.ac.uk/plant-morphogenesis/people/
Eleonora's secondary supervisor is Tolga as her project focusses on understanding the role of electrotaxis in Phytophthora palmivora infection and the mechanisms behind this. When she's not in the lab you can find Eleonora performing ballet in London.
