Cian was a Postdoc/PhD Student at the Bozkurt lab in Imperial, studying where NLRs localise in plant cells during infection with the potato blight pathogen and how this localisation contributes to disease resistance. 

He recently started a biotech company on NLR biology with Tolga, called Resurrect Bio, learn more at www.resurrect.bio
