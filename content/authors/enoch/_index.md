Cian is a Postdoc at the Bozkurt lab in Imperial, studying where NLRs localise in plant cells during infection with the potato blight pathogen and how this localisation contributes to disease resistance. 

He will soon be leaving the Bozkurt lab to start a biotech company on NLR biology with Tolga.
